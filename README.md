# 🚀 Abdul Kheeyan — Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

A modern **backend-driven portfolio website** built using **Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB Atlas**, designed with a scalable server-side architecture instead of static pages.

This project demonstrates real-world backend structuring, server-side rendering, and cloud database integration — reflecting how production applications are built.

## 🌍 Project Vision

Unlike traditional static portfolios, this project is built using a **backend-first approach** with database connectivity. It showcases how a developer portfolio can be structured like a real application, making it:

- Scalable  
- Maintainable  
- Dynamic  
- Ready for full-stack expansion  

## 🧠 Core Engineering Concepts

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using EJS  
- Express.js routing & middleware flow  
- MVC-inspired architecture  
- Reusable layout & partial components  
- REST-style backend handling  
- Cloud database integration (MongoDB Atlas)  
- Structured project organization  

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### **Frontend Layer**
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

### **Backend Layer**
- Node.js
- Express.js

### **Database**
- MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)

### **Development & Tooling**
- Git & GitHub
- npm ecosystem
- Modular code architecture

## ✨ Key Features

✔ Dynamic page rendering with EJS  
✔ Backend-powered portfolio architecture  
✔ MongoDB Atlas database connectivity  
✔ Clean, minimal, and professional UI  
✔ Reusable layout components  
✔ Fully responsive design  
✔ Optimized static asset serving  
✔ Structured and maintainable codebase  

## 📂 Project Architecture

```bash
Abdul-Kheeyan-Portfolio/
│
├── public/        # Static assets (CSS, JS, Images)
├── views/         # EJS templates & layouts
├── models/        # Database models
├── index.js       # Main server file
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## ⚙️ Application Flow

1. Client sends a request  
2. Express.js handles routing  
3. Server processes logic  
4. Data can be fetched/stored via MongoDB Atlas  
5. EJS renders dynamic views  
6. Static files served from `/public`

This mirrors real-world backend-driven web applications.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Admin panel for content management  
- Contact form with database storage  
- Authentication & authorization  
- REST APIs for external integrations  
- Migration to full MERN stack  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📌 Prerequisites
- Node.js installed  
- npm installed  
- MongoDB Atlas account  

### 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdul-kheeyan/Abdul-Kheeyan-Portfolio.git
cd Abdul-Kheeyan-Portfolio
npm install
```

### ⚙ Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
MY_EMAIL=your_gmail@gmail.com
APP_PASS=your_16_char_google_app_password
PORT=8080
```

**Render deploy:** In the Render dashboard → your Web Service → **Environment**, add the same three variables (`MONGO_URI`, `MY_EMAIL`, `APP_PASS`). The `.env` file is not uploaded to Render.

**Gmail App Password:** Turn on 2-Step Verification, then create an app password at [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). Use that 16-character password as `APP_PASS` (not your normal Gmail password).

### ▶ Run the Application

```bash
node index.js
```

Visit in browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
